# writertoys
A handful of simple web toys for writers, to help create plots, characters, settings, and conflict.

Here are some of the things writertoys will help with:

* create story ideas
* create character names, outlines and backgrounds
* create character quirks and flaws
* create conflicts and suspense
* create settings
* create an outline with major plot points
* create a log line
* create a synopsis
* create backstory

For blogs, I'm hoping to make some writertoys help:

* create blog ideas
* find a theme for several related blog posts

I'm creating this with python2.7 and Flask. I use virtualenv with this, but I don't plan to
check in the venv directory with the installed libraries (Flask and it's dependencies).
