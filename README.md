# writertoys

DISCLAIMER: I'm not expecting anyone to look at this project, or use it, or contribute to it, for
quite a while. I'm using it as a learning exercise more than anything else at the moment, with the
goal of eventually knowing python, flask, sqlalchemy, and so on. I will remove this disclaimer when
I think the project has reached MVP (minimum viable project) stage. That won't be for a while.

NOTE: I'm not abandoning this project, but I've decided to spend some time really focusing on
another project (goodwin), which I will then use to try to help make this project.

A handful of simple web toys for writers, to help create plots, characters, settings, and conflict.

Here are some of the things writertoys will help with:

* create story ideas
* create character names, outlines and backgrounds
* create character quirks and flaws
* create conflicts and suspense
* create settings
* create an outline with major plot points
* create a log line
* create a synopsis
* create backstory

For blogs, I'm hoping to make some writertoys help:

* create blog ideas
* find a theme for several related blog posts

I'm creating this with python3.6.2 and Flask. I use virtualenv with this, but I don't plan to
check in the venv directory with the installed libraries (Flask and it's dependencies).

I think the following might be a good source for instructions on how to make writertoys
installable as a python package:
