The USA 2000 census has a list of all the surnames with more than 100 people, here:

http://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/2000_surnames.html

I'm planning to use those (just the names, not the statistics) in the name generator.
Actually, probably just the names with 1000 or more people (Vidmar and up).
