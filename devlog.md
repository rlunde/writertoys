I'm using python 2.7.10 on a Macbook Pro as I develop this, and started by installing virtualenv.py for it using:

sudo easy_install virtualenv

I created a flask virtualenv directory (not to be checked in) via:

virtualenv flask

I followed the first two sections in [Miquel Grinberg's tutorial on Flask](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-ii-templates)
(except I didn't use his microblog structure).
