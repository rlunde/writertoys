The client was initially made via https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app

I'm trying it with yarn.

I'm following the Udemy course by Stephen Grider, section 6, and trying to add
my own content at the same time. Yikes!

https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/content
https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter

yarn upgrade --upgrade-interactive
yarn start
yarn add react-router

"yarn build" said this:
=======================================
Rons-MBP:client ron$ yarn build
yarn build v0.27.5
$ react-scripts build
Creating an optimized production build...
Compiled successfully.

File sizes after gzip:

  48.29 KB  build/static/js/main.24a4ad74.js
  288 B     build/static/css/main.cacbacc7.css

The project was built assuming it is hosted at the server root.
To override this, specify the homepage in your package.json.
For example, add this to build it for GitHub Pages:

  "homepage" : "http://myname.github.io/myapp",

The build folder is ready to be deployed.
You may serve it with a static server:

  yarn global add serve
  serve -s build

Done in 14.41s.
=======================================

"yarn start" launched a chrome tab to localhost:3000 which included this:
To get started, edit src/components/App.js and save to reload.

I'm following along with Stephen Grider's Udemy react-redux video tutorial,
starting in section 6.

react-router includes node_modules/history

history sends updated url to react-router, which sends new components to react,
which renders.

In order to catch up to Stephen Grider, I need to try to add the stuff from 
his react-simple-starter project (redux, in particular) to the framework installed
by create-react-app (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

I think in order to tie in auth and sessions with sideauth, I'll use axios with
an interceptor to validate the session: https://github.com/axios/axios#interceptors
There's an example here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43326383/using-session-cookies-in-react

Maybe that's too complicated for a first attempt? Probably better to start out
with just looking at the cookie in every render. Looks like a universal-cookie module 
may be what I could use? 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/universal-cookie
import Cookies from 'universal-cookie';
 
const cookies = new Cookies();
 
cookies.set('myCat', 'Pacman', { path: '/' });
console.log(cookies.get('myCat')); // Pacman

There's also a react-cookie module that looks interesting.

Oh boy. react-router v4 is a complete rewrite, and the stuff
Stephen Grider is using is gone -- browserHistory, for example.
I'm trying to figure out the replacement starting with
https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/issues/5263

I wanted to just get a basic client layout working with the
react/redux sample I started with, yesterday, but something
is really messed up with the CSS. I think I can't just use
regular bootstrap, but need to use react-bootstrap? I'm
going to look into that tonight.

This looks promising:
https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/301

npm install react-bootstrap --save
-----
in App.js:
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.css';
import { Nav, NavItem, MenuItem, Navbar, NavDropdown } from 'react-bootstrap'

See: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components.html

OK, that's all I have time for tonight, but it's a step in
the right direction. I need to read that react-bootstrap page 
before I try any more layout.

I'm weighting my time towards making progress on the goodwin
project, so I haven't had much time to work on this.

I tried a WHOLE LOT of things tonight for a couple of hours
to try to get the main div of the layout to stretch vertically
between the nav and the footer, using flexbox, and nothing
worked. Giving up for now.
