I'm trying my 1.2.3 approach:
1) pick the top priority task
2) make it easier to start or resume
3) split it into smaller tasks or do it

Next Steps
  1.1 create story ideas
  1.2 
    1.2.1 make a data+template driven random "mad lib" generator
    1.2.2 find and extract common plot outlines
    1.2.3 make a top-level panel in the SPA page for story idea
  1.3
    1.3.1 move all the files that aren't part of the new Flask project out of the way
    1.3.2 make a very basic SPA page with minimal layout
      1.3.2.1 try starting client with https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate

Failed experiments:
    1.3.1 start with mad lib generator 
        * the problem with most of these is that they prompt the user,
          while I want something that builds up lists of replacements
          from a database or a yaml/json file
