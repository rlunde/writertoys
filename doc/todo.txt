I'm trying my 1.2.3 approach:
1) pick the top priority task
2) make it easier to start or resume
3) split it into smaller tasks or do it

Stack:
(1) make a react-based SPA app for a client, with a Flask backend
(1.1) do a basic layout, postpone doing account signup/auth/etc.
(1.1.1) create a SPA layout with a navbar, footer, sidebar, and content area
(1.2) create story ideas
(1.2.1) make a top-level panel in the SPA page for story idea
(1.2.2) make a data+template driven random "mad lib" generator
(1.2.3) find and extract common plot outlines


Failed experiments:
    x start with a sample mad lib generator 
        * the problem with most of these is that they prompt the user,
          while I want something that builds up lists of replacements
          from a database or a yaml/json file
