Try using funtodone (https://github.com/rlunde/funtodone) to develop writertoys.

A "stack" is like a hierarchical todo list, except that you go depth first, so you
only expand one task from the parent level. That is, rather than this:

1.
  a.
  b.
2.
  a.
  b.

You have this:

1.
2.
3.
  a.
  b.
  c.
    i.
    ii.

There's a lot more to it than that, but basically it's a way to avoid
planning until the heat death of the universe by limiting how far you
can plan before you have to actually do something.
