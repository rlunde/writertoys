Ideas:

character profile editor
  choose basic template, and select which items you want
  random suggestions for each item, or examples
  emotional arc
  how does character change?
outline editor
story structure editor -- answer questions (see notes from Orycon)

writing prompts
synopsis editor
beat sheet editor
conflict brainstorming
suspense brainstorming

I know gamification has got a really bad rep, but I'd also
like to think of ways to make using this tool fun in itself.
Whether that's by adding game-related elements is an open
question. I'm not sure it makes sense to "be" a game, at least
not in the sense that the late Bernard Suits meant by "games
are a voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles" (golf
is a good example -- there are easier ways to put a ball in 
a cup, if for some reason that's something that you need to
do). 

But some elements might be quite fun, such as:
a) animations
b) surprises
c) score (e.g. you get more points the closer you come to a complete story)
d) easter eggs
e) humor

The trick is to come up with fun things like that without losing
sight of what it's actually for.
