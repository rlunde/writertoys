Ideas:

character profile editor
  choose basic template, and select which items you want
  random suggestions for each item, or examples
  emotional arc
  how does character change?
outline editor
story structure editor -- answer questions (see notes from Orycon)

writing prompts
synopsis editor
beat sheet editor
conflict brainstorming
suspense brainstorming

I know gamification has got a really bad rep, but I'd also
like to think of ways to make using this tool fun in itself.
Whether that's by adding game-related elements is an open
question. I'm not sure it makes sense to "be" a game, at least
not in the sense that the late Bernard Suits meant by "games
are a voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles" (golf
is a good example -- there are easier ways to put a ball in 
a cup, if for some reason that's something that you need to
do). 

But some elements might be quite fun, such as:
a) animations
b) surprises
c) score (e.g. you get more points the closer you come to a complete story)
d) easter eggs
e) humor

The trick is to come up with fun things like that without losing
sight of what it's actually for.

The most complete character name generator I've seen so far is:

That base website has a ton of data about both first names and surnames, as well.

I think for our purposes, we don't really need nearly that number of types. I think maybe
male or female, a handful of countries where it might be seen, and a link off to
that website if people want to go nuts.
