[ ] I've forgotten everything
  [ ] list all files here (that I wrote)
    [ ] say what they do, why I wrote them
    [ ] say what the next step is
  [ ] go through the todo list, find the next 3 things to do
    [ ] for each thing, write down next steps to do it
  [ ] figure out how to avoid getting myself in the same spot in the future
    [ ] focus on making it easy to restart work on a project
