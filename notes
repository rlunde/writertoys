Starting over with this, then I'll take things one step at a time:

I'll be using postgres instead of mysql, but I don't think there's likely to be anything msql-specific in such a small example.

OK, so no real progress today, but I did read a lot about things. So I'm going to check this in anyway, because I made progress,
even if it was all just mental.

In the long run, everything is mental.

I was planning to do a lot today, but I feel awful.
