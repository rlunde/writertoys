Restarting using python3

Trying by starting with the actual Flask manual
in the doc directory. (I know -- shocking, right?)
I got it from: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/.latex/Flask.pdf

See doc/Flask.pdf

WriterToys Web Architecture:
-----------------------------
My goal is to make this app "modern" in the sense that I
don't do anything with HTML or CSS or Javascript (other than
serve them up) in python. Unfortunately, Flask (like Rails or
most other web frameworks) is designed with the idea that
you're going to be doing a lot of template-based rendering.

I don't want to do that. For Flask, I just want to do REST.
I don't even want to serve up static content: I would rather
do that with nginx, and just proxy the REST APIs through to
Flask from nginx. (The proxy stuff is mostly so I don't have
to wrangle CORS and stuff like that for such a simple app.
Is that lazy?) I still need to figure out how XSS prevention
works in that architecture -- but I'd rather have to actually
figure it out myself than just assume it's all taken care of.
