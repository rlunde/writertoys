Starting over with this, then I'll take things one step at a time:
http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creating-a-web-app-from-scratch-using-python-flask-and-mysql--cms-22972

I'll be using postgres instead of mysql, but I don't think there's likely to be anything msql-specific in such a small example.

Actually, Flask has a whole book, which I've started reading.
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/

The next step is to build static pages that looks like:

  a) landing page with explanation of what the site is for
  b) main page with a menu for all the fun

The landing page should have:
  a) some kind of logo
  b) fun quote of the day about writing
  c) three options
    i) log in
    ii) sign up
    iii) goof around anonymously
  d) an about link
  e) a nice image background
  f) animation around the three options

Initially, the login and signup pages should just pop up a
modal that says "sorry, login and signup are under construction,
but you can still do everything else except save your results
remotely (you can export them to a local file)." That modal
should have a link to the main page, which is where the "goof
around anonymously" link takes you.

The main page should have a menu like:

[ ] character generator
  [ ] character name generator
  [ ] character background generator
  [ ] character quirks generator
  [ ] character flaws generator

[ ] plot outline generator
  [ ] select a kind of outline
  [ ] kinds of conflict
  [ ] character development
  [ ] types of suspense
  [ ] sources of humor

[ ] setting generator
  [ ] past / present / future
  [ ] land / sea / space
  [ ] temperature / weather
  [ ] indoors / outdoors
  [ ] time of day
  [ ] season / time of year

The character name, background, etc. output should go one tab of the rest of page
The plot outline output should go a second tab of the rest of page
The setting output goes in a third tab of the rest of page

I think characters might be best done as hierarchical lists:

  1) Character: Sherlock Holmes
    a) Background: criminology, drama, pugilism, chemistry, anatomy
    b) Quirks: loves disguises, bees, problems to solve
    c) Flaws: takes drugs when bored, arrogant, impatient
  2) Character: John Watson
    a) Background: medicine, military
    b) Quirks: writes stories
    c) Flaws: easily fooled
