I'm trying this in Flask, starting with the tutorial here:
http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world
and using the tutorial here for inspiration on the client side:
https://realpython.com/blog/python/the-ultimate-flask-front-end/

Also, I'm a believer in doing client-type things with client-type code, and server-type things
with server-type code, so I don't like the idea of writing single-threaded server code in
Javascript or transpiled server code that runs in the browser. So for this
project, I'll stick with Python on the server side and JavaScript on the client
side.

Since I'm trying to improve my skills at bootstrap, backbone, and other javascript frameworks
now, the client pages will be in that while the server side will be all APIs (aside from serving
up static resources used by the client).
