I have the database stuff (good enough for now) under data,
and the cli implementation under cli, for name generation.

I used yeoman ("yo flask-api") to generate this top level python
for flask in a virtualenv.  See "notes" for the gory details.

So next, in order to have a minimal Flask server that has
an API to generate names, and a web page that uses the API,
I just need to:

Done:

* make a directory for html/css/js and an instance of nginx that serves that content.
* use a reverse proxy in the nginx config to map the flask service to an API url.

ToDo:

* modify the web page to hide all the landing page stuff when someone clicks on names link
* use flask code to load the names in memory, and handle the 
  /names/random URI (probably /names/random?gender=female&number=10 )
* do a paper prototype of what a SPA should look like
* modify page to call GET API to get a random name (or a collection of names)
* make the simplest names generation page that I can
* change it to save names by dragging them to a save list
