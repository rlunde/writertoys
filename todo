I'm trying this in Flask, starting with the tutorial here:
http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world
and using the tutorial here for inspiration on the client side:
https://realpython.com/blog/python/the-ultimate-flask-front-end/

Also, I'm a believer in doing client-type things with client-type code, and server-type things
with server-type code, so I don't like the idea of writing single-threaded server code in
Javascript or transpiled server code that runs in the browser. So for this
project, I'll stick with Python on the server side and JavaScript on the client
side.

Since I'm trying to improve my skills at bootstrap, backbone, and other javascript frameworks
now, the client pages will be in that while the server side will be all APIs (aside from serving
up static resources used by the client).

[ ] start with a character idea generator, just to get going
  [ ] character name generator -- generate a few at a time, and let user retry or choose one
  [ ] character background generator
  [ ] character quirks generator
  [ ] character flaws generator

Character:
  Name:
  Age:
  Sex:
  Cultural Background:
    Nationality:
    Ethnicity:
    Religion/Beliefs:
  Appearance:
    Hair:
    Skin:
    Height:
    Weight:
    Unusual characteristics:
  Personality:
  Quirks:
    Emotional:
    Fears:
    Likes/Dislikes:

[ ] each attribute should let user "pin it" so that they can regenerate everything else
  [ ] hierarchical or composite things should let you "pin" part of it -- e.g. pin setting location but not weather
[ ] user should be able to regenerate a single attribute at any level of heirarchy
    
Misc:
[ ] convert from auth using OpenID to another auth (e.g. Oath)

[ ] make a plot outline editor / generator
  [ ] select a kind of outline (e.g. how many major milestone points)
  [ ] random suggestions for kinds of conflict
  [ ] random suggestions for character development
  [ ] random suggestions for types of suspense
  [ ] random suggestions for sources of humor

[ ] have templates available for filling out
  [ ] can add your own templates, or import from files
  [ ] for each kind of outline, have a sample set of templates
    [ ] short stories
    [ ] novels
    [ ] mysteries
    [ ] thrillers
    [ ] flash fiction

[ ] make a setting generator / editor
  [ ] past / present / future
  [ ] land / sea / space
  [ ] temperature / weather
  [ ] indoors / outdoors
  [ ] time of day
  [ ] season / time of year

[ ] try to reduce the number of things people *have* to do
  [ ] generate groups of things and let user choose which one(s) they like
  [ ] reduce set of possibilities (e.g. first choose whether name is "conventional" or "unique")
  [ ] generate a complete set of things and let user trim, if that's simpler than adding
  [ ] don't insist on any level of "completeness" -- let user decide

[ ] guide people through developing their own ideas
  [ ] start with a "what if" (e.g. "what if genetic engineers made elephants the size of dogs")
  [ ] continue to develop an idea with follow-up questions (e.g. "and what if they could talk?")
  [ ] help people find sources of conflict (beliefs, preferences, personality types...)

[ ] decide on first steps, and make a first vertical "Spike"
  [ ]  do basic layout showing placeholders for features
  [ ] start character name generator
    [ ] design schema for names
    [ ] write code to generate names
    [ ] generate names with a single type (e.g. female,  contemporary, american)

[ ] overall strategy
  [ ] make it as data driven as possible
  [ ] try to get something minimally useful released as quickly as possible, to start getting feedback
  [ ] focus on features that make it fun and useful, rather than complete

[ ] things to keep in mind
  [ ] should be fun, and funny (but practical)
  [ ] try to make it easy to suggest additional content and features
  [ ] see if there's a way to make a game out of it (contest for flash fiction?)

[ ] schema thoughts
  [ ] top level should be users (with login/authentication) and stories
  [ ] stories should be just a JSON bag to hold 0 or more of each kind of thing (characters, titles, settings)
  [ ] should be able to mark one thing as the current selection (e.g. the title) without losing other possibilities
  [ ] metadata should control what goes in stories (should be able to add a kind of story element without modifying schema)

[ ] overall theme
  [ ] start with something like a good bootstrap template, and modify it
  [ ] need to decide what people can do without creating an account, or creating a "story" to save things in?

[ ] ok, let's start from the top
  [ ] what can I do that makes a difference?
