I have the database stuff (good enough for now) under data,
and the cli implementation under cli, for name generation.

I used yeoman ("yo flask-api") to generate this top level python
for flask in a virtualenv.  See "notes" for the gory details.
I'm nervous about using yeoman for anything now, though, so
we'll see whether I stick with this structure or not.

I'm getting started by following 

the React tutorial: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html

ToDo Next:

...
3) make the database connection configuration driven (not just "localhost")
4) make the Flask API URI configuration driven (not just "localhost:5000")
5) make an incrementally better layout of name generator 
6) make an incrementally better layout of main SPA page
7) improve this todo list by breaking down into stories/features
N) see if I can generate part of the code for the names page using goodwin
