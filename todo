I have the database stuff (good enough for now) under data,
and the cli implementation under cli, for name generation.

I used yeoman ("yo flask-api") to generate this top level python
for flask in a virtualenv.  See "notes" for the gory details.

So next, in order to have a minimal Flask server that has
an API to generate names, and a web page that uses the API,
I just need to:

x) make a directory for html/css/js and an instance of nginx
   that serves that content.
2) use a reverse proxy in the nginx config to map the flask
   service to an API url.
3) make a tiny web page that calls ajax GET to get a random
   name (or a collection of names)
4) make the flask code to load the names in memory, and handle
   the /names/random URI (probably /names/random?gender=female&number=10 )
5) do another paper prototype to expand the names feature and
   add another.
